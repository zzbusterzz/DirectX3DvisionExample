## 3D Vision DirectX NVAPI Direct Mode

This code was orignally taken from the user [bo3b](https://github.com/bo3b/3D-Vision-Direct "bo3b") for 3d Vision DirectX rendering. This example is again based one [DirectX tutorial](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/Direct3D-Tutorial-Win32-829979ef "DirectX tutorial "). I do not own any of this code. This is a reference example for future use. Only things I have modified are adding Log support to check the status of NVAPI callback & setup to windows 10 SDK with VS Community 2017

#### Requirements:
- Windows 10 SDK v 10.0.17134.0
- VS Community 2017
